# Growth Balls
The goal of this program is to create a game with a single player controlled ball and many other balls. The non-player balls should move around using the same movement code we've been using. The player ball will follow the mouse. When the player ball collides with another ball, that ball will stop moving and begin to grow in size. Once a growing ball has reached a specific maximum size, it will begin to shrink (not moving). Once a shrinking ball has reached a specific minimum size, it will stop shrinking, and should no longer move, grow or shrink.
